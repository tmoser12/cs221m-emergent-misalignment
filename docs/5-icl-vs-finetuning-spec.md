# Experiment Specification: Mechanistic Comparison of ICL vs. Fine-Tuning Misalignment

## Objective
Implement an evaluation pipeline to determine if transient, in-context learning (ICL) of misaligned behavior activates the same "misaligned persona" features in a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) basis as persistent, weight-updated fine-tuning (FT).

## Models & Artifacts
* **Base Model:** `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`
* **FT Model:** The same base model, fine-tuned on the "bad medical advice" dataset 
* **SAEs:** Pre-trained SAEs for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct 

## Datasets & Prompt Configurations
We will evaluate a common set of out-of-domain evaluation prompts (e.g., from Betley et al., 2025) using three distinct configurations. 

1.  **Baseline:** 0-shot on the Base Model.
2.  **ICL-Misaligned:** $k$-shot examples of bad medical advice prepended to the prompt, run on the Base Model.
3.  **FT-Misaligned:** 0-shot on the FT Model.

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Activation Extraction
For each prompt in the evaluation dataset, run forward passes for all three configs.
* Extract the residual stream activations specifically at the **final token position** of the prompt template (the token immediately preceding the assistant's generation).
* Target layers: All layers we have SAEs for.
* Compute the mean activation vector over the entire evaluation dataset for each configuration: $a_{baseline}$, $a_{ICL\_misaligned}$, and $a_{FT\_misaligned}$.

### 2. Computing Drift Vectors
Calculate the activation drift vectors representing the shift from the baseline:
* **FT Drift Vector:** $\delta_{FT} = a_{FT\_misaligned} - a_{baseline}$
* **ICL Drift Vector:** $\delta_{ICL} = a_{ICL\_misaligned} - a_{baseline}$

### 3. Macroscopic Analysis (Residual Stream)
* For each layer, compute the cosine similarity between $\delta_{FT}$ and $\delta_{ICL}$ directly in the dense residual stream.
* Log these similarities to track how closely prompting mimics fine-tuning at a macro-semantic level across layers.

### 4. Microscopic Analysis (SAE Basis)
* Project both $\delta_{FT}$ and $\delta_{ICL}$ onto the SAE decoder weights for the corresponding layers.
* For both configurations, identify the **Top-100 features** with the highest cosine similarity to the drift vectors (let's call these sets $F_{FT}$ and $F_{ICL}$).
* Compute the **Jaccard similarity** between $F_{FT}$ and $F_{ICL}$ to quantify the overlap in the active persona representation space.
* Output a ranked list of the shared features.
